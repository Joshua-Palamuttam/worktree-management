# Worktree Commands Reference

All commands work in both **Git Bash** and **Windows Command Prompt**.

---

## Navigation Commands

### `wtgo`
Jump to the worktrees root directory.

```cmd
wtgo
```
**Result:** Changes directory to `C:\worktrees-SeekOut\`

---

### `wtr [repo]`
Jump to a repository's bare directory, or list available repos.

```cmd
# List all available repos
wtr

# Jump to a specific repo
wtr backend
wtr AI-1099
```
**Result:** Changes directory to `C:\worktrees-SeekOut\<repo>.git\`

---

### `wtd [repo]`
Jump to the develop worktree.

```cmd
# From anywhere in a repo, jump to its develop worktree
wtd

# Jump to a specific repo's develop worktree
wtd backend
```
**Result:** Changes directory to `<repo>.git\develop\`

---

### `wtm [repo]`
Jump to the main worktree.

```cmd
# From anywhere in a repo, jump to its main worktree
wtm

# Jump to a specific repo's main worktree
wtm backend
```
**Result:** Changes directory to `<repo>.git\main\`

---

### `wtl`
List all worktrees in the current repository.

```cmd
wtl
```
**Example output:**
```
C:/worktrees-SeekOut/AI-1099.git          (bare)
C:/worktrees-SeekOut/AI-1099.git/develop  4bd11bde (detached HEAD)
C:/worktrees-SeekOut/AI-1099.git/main     9733532f (detached HEAD)
```

---

## Repository Setup Commands

### `wt-migrate`
Migrate a repository to the worktree structure.

**From GitHub URL (recommended):**
```cmd
wt-migrate --from-url https://github.com/Org/repo.git

# With custom name
wt-migrate --from-url https://github.com/Org/repo.git my-custom-name
```

**From existing local directory:**
```cmd
wt-migrate --from-dir "C:\path\to\existing\repo"

# With custom name
wt-migrate --from-dir "C:\Seekout\backend" backend
```

**What it does:**
1. Clones the repository as a bare repo (`repo.git/`)
2. Configures remote tracking for all branches
3. Creates `main/` worktree (from main or master branch)
4. Creates `develop/` worktree (if develop branch exists)
5. Creates `_feature/`, `_review/`, `_hotfix/` directories

---

### `wt-init`
Initialize a new repository for worktree workflow (alternative to wt-migrate).

```cmd
wt-init https://github.com/Org/repo.git
```

**Note:** `wt-migrate` is preferred as it has more options.

---

## Feature Development Commands

### `wt-feature`
Create a new feature worktree from develop.

```cmd
wt-feature my-feature-name
wt-feature AI-1234-add-login
wt-feature joshua/experimental-thing
```

**What it does:**
1. Fetches latest from origin
2. Creates new branch from `origin/develop`
3. Creates worktree at `_feature/<name>/`
4. Sets up upstream tracking

**Result:** New worktree at `<repo>.git\_feature\<name>\`

---

### `wt-hotfix`
Create a hotfix worktree from develop for urgent fixes.

```cmd
wt-hotfix critical-bug-fix
wt-hotfix payment-issue
```

**What it does:**
1. Fetches latest from origin
2. Creates new branch `hotfix/<name>` from `origin/develop`
3. Creates worktree at `_hotfix/<name>/`

**Result:** New worktree at `<repo>.git\_hotfix\<name>\`

---

### `wt-hotfix-done`
Clean up a hotfix worktree after merging.

```cmd
wt-hotfix-done critical-bug-fix
wt-hotfix-done payment-issue
```

**What it does:**
1. Removes the `_hotfix/<name>/` worktree
2. Prunes git worktree references

---

## Code Review Commands

### `wt-review`
Quickly checkout a PR or branch for review.

```cmd
# By PR number (requires gh CLI for best experience)
wt-review 123
wt-review 4567

# By branch name
wt-review feature/someones-feature
wt-review joshua/new-api
```

**What it does:**
1. Removes any existing review worktree
2. Fetches the PR or branch from origin
3. Creates worktree at `_review/current/`

**Result:** Ready to review at `<repo>.git\_review\current\`

**Note:** Your current feature work is completely untouched!

---

### `wt-review-done`
Clean up the review worktree after completing a review.

```cmd
wt-review-done
```

**What it does:**
1. Removes the `_review/current/` worktree
2. Prunes git worktree references
3. Deletes the local PR branch (if it was a PR)

---

### `wt-remove`
Remove a feature, hotfix, or any worktree when you're done with it.

```cmd
# Remove a feature worktree
wt-remove AI-1234-feature

# Remove a hotfix worktree
wt-remove critical-fix

# Force remove (with uncommitted changes)
wt-remove my-branch --force
```

**What it does:**
1. Finds the worktree in `_feature/`, `_hotfix/`, or `_review/`
2. Removes the worktree
3. Prunes git references
4. Tells you how to delete the branch if desired

---

## Maintenance Commands

### `wt-status`
Show status of all worktrees across all repositories.

```cmd
# All repos
wt-status

# Specific repo
wt-status backend
```

**Example output:**
